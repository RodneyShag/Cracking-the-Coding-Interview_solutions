9.2 - Social Network

     - Use BFS to find (shortest) path between 2 people.
     - To Handle the Millions of Users (which won't fit on one machine)
             - Server Should have:
                 - HashMap<Integer, Machine> machines (which maps machine's ID to the actual machine)
                 - HashMap<lnteger, Integer> personToMachineMap (which maps person's ID to machine's ID)
             - Machine should have:
                 - HashMap<Integer, Person> persons (which maps person's ID to Person)
     - Optimization: Reduce Machine Jumps - Look up 5 things at once instead of 1 by 1 (see book for details)
