7.6 - Jigsaw

	1) 3 Classes - Puzzle, Piece (which has 4 Edges), Edge (which can be "inner", "outer", or "flat").
	2) Book's solution is overly complex. I would be able to solve this with my own algorithm: 
	 		- Split Pieces into corner, edge, and center pieces. Then can simply loop through 2D array and brute-force pieces until it works.
	 		- Putting Edges into lists of "inner", "outer", or "flat" will enable us to only try pieces with proper edge configurations..
