7.7 - Chat Server
	 
	Class: Conversation (with subclasses GroupChat and PrivateChat). User. AddRequest.
	----------------------------------- important lesson of when to use ArrayList vs. HashMap
	For fast lookup, book used:
		private HashMap<Integer, User> usersByld;
	 	private HashMap<String, User> usersByAccountName;
	 	private HashMap<Integer, User> onlineUsers;
	 
	Uses: HashMap<Integer, PrivateChat> privateChats, 
	      HashMap<Integer, AddRequest> receivedAddRequests
	      HashMap<Integer, User> contacts
	      ...I think using ArrayList instead of HashMap for these may have its own pros/cons. Maybe like this:
	      ArrayList<PrivateChat> privateChats
	      ArrayList<AddRequest> receivedAddRequests
	      ArrayList<User> contacts
	"Tough problems to solve": Security, out-of-sync data / conflicting information.
